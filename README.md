#MFD Tailboard
------

This Android application is for members of the Madisonville Fire Department. It was initially a simple payday calculator application titled MFDPayday. As it has evolved a number of new features have been added. This new adaptation includes a shift calendar, callback tracker, payday calculator, vacation / sick time tracker, and todo section.

The base application still remains the payday calculator as it is the most relevant to me and will likely be the most developed simply due the the previous code being integrated into the new app. This will allow for calculation of Base Pay, Gross Pay, Taxes, and Deposit amount for a given pay date. It will take into account an employee's base-pay rate, holiday hours, longevity, overtime rates 1 & 2, and all deductions based on their current rank.

Please direct all questions & comments to c9design@corridor9design.com. In addition, I respectfully request to be notified of all bugs or issues that may exist via the email address versus negative feedback in the Play store. It is very hard to have a dialog with someone to fix an issue when a single star with a comment is left on the application download page.I would also appreciate any input on additional features that users feel should be added.

Current source code for this project can be found at my GitHub page [@Rescue9](https://github.com/Rescue9).
