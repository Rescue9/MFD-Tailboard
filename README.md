This Android application is for members of the Madisonville Fire Department. It is currently a simple paycheck calculator. However, this is likely to be expanded to include a shift calendar, note section, and time swap log. This application will calculate the Base Pay, Gross Pay, Taxes, and Deposit amount for a given pay date. It calculates base-pay rate, holiday hours, longevity, and overtime rates 1 & 2, and all deductions.

Please direct all questions & comments to c9design@corridor9design.com. In addition, I respectfully request to be notified for all bugs or issues found via the email address versus negative feedback in the Play store. I would also appreciate any input on how to make my code cleaner, or additional features that could be added.

Current source code for this project can be found at my GitHub page (@Rescue9).
